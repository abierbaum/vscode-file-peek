# Functionality

This extension extends HTML and ejs code editing with `Go To Definition` and `Go To Symbol in Workspace` support for css/scss/less (classes and IDs) found in strings within the source code.

This was heavily inspired by a similar feature in [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) called CSS Inline Editors.

The extension supports all the normal capabilities of symbol definition tracking, but does it for css selectors (classes, IDs and HTML tags). This includes:

 * Peek: load the css file inline and make quick edits right there. (`Ctrl+Shift+F12`)
 * Go To: jump directly to the css file or open it in a new editor (`F12`)
 * Hover: show the definition in a hover over the symbol (`Ctrl+hover`)

In addition, it supports the Symbol Provider so you can quickly jump to the right CSS/SCSS/LESS code if you already know the class or ID name
